# ReactJS
This repo comprises of all mini-projects I embark on while studying ReactJS from scratch
The first step was to install and set up reactjs obviously. This task is pretty easy :)
I used https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-install-and-setup-a-react-app-on-windows-10/ as my instruction manual. It's pretty easy and simple to follow. The instructions work both on windows and linux os.
